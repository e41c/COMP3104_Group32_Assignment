## Hello! Welcome to Group 32's Dev Ops Assignment
My name is *Ryan Lee* and welcome to my branch of the assignment! The purpose of the assignment was to introduce us to basic bash line commands and GitHub repository structuring.

## Commands that constructed our GitHub Repository
```
git init <directory>            //Create empty git repo in specified directory
git clone <repo>                //Clones <repo> locally
git remote add <ssh>            //Adds connection to a remote repo
git pull                        //Fetchs remote copy of current branch & merges
git branch <branch name>        //Creates a new branch in the repo
git branch -a                   //Shows all branches in the repo
git checkout <branch name>      //Moves to selected branch
git add .                       //Stages all changes in the <directory> to commit
git commit -m ""                //Commit the stagged code and a message locally  
git push                        //Push the branch to remote repo
git merge <branch>              //Merge <branch> into current branch
```
